/* React: Render with an If/Else Condition
Another application of using JavaScript to control your rendered view is to tie the elements that are rendered to a condition. When the condition is true, one view renders. When it's false, it's a different view. You can do this with a standard if/else statement in the render() method of a React component.

import React, { Component } from 'react'

export class Conditionals1 extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Conditionals1
